# FormFlow

FormFlow is a streamlined web application designed for managing and processing forms, ideal for businesses and organizations that need efficient and secure handling of various forms submitted by users. The application provides account creation and user login, multiple forms per user, unique URLs for each form, and a user-friendly interface to view and manage form submissions.

## Project Purpose

The goal of FormFlow is to simplify the process of collecting, organizing, and managing data from various forms in a centralized system. It can serve different use cases, including:

- Feedback collection
- Surveys and polls
- Registration and contact forms
- Custom forms for any organization-specific needs

FormFlow allows users to create an account, manage multiple forms under their account, and generate unique links for each form, making it ideal for businesses or individuals looking for a versatile form management system.

## Key Features

- **User Account System**: Secure login and account creation for users to manage their forms.
- **Multiple Form Creation**: Users can create, customize, and manage multiple forms under a single account.
- **Unique Form URLs**: Each form generates a unique URL, which can be shared for easy access.
- **Data Display**: Form submissions are displayed in an organized table format for easy data analysis.
- **Secure Backend**: Built with security and data protection in mind, utilizing environment-based configurations and CORS for controlled access.

## Planned Technologies and Frameworks

### Backend

- **Express.js**: Node.js framework for handling server-side logic and APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database used to store user and form data.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separation of concerns to keep the application maintainable and scalable.

### Frontend
